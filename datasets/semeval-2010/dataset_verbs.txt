by prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men the nationstate maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order within its territorial borders outside those limits it	as against other states a position of sovereign equality and as against the inferior peoples of the nonwestern world a position of dominance it became the sole subject of international law lrb a term which it is pertinent to remember was coined by bentham rrb a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what western nations could do in the world arena
the rule of law historically a principle according everyone his day in court before an impartial tribunal was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare recognizing that the rule of law is a dynamic concept which should be employed not only to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free society the congress	that it also included the responsibility to establish social economic educational and cultural conditions under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized the idea of national responsibility thus has become a common feature of the nations of the nonsoviet world
reference to two other concepts nationalism and sovereignty may help to reveal the contours of the new principle in its beginnings the nationstate had to struggle to	itself internally against feudal groups and externally against the power and influence of such other claimants for loyalty as the church the breakup of the holy roman empire and the downfall of feudalism led not more than two centuries ago to the surge of nationalism
all seven combined ardent devotion to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality john adams	in the continental congress declaration of rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their charters the british constitution and the common law and jefferson appealed in the declaration of independence to the tribunal of the world for support of a revolution justified by the laws of nature and of nature s god they fought hard but they were forgiving to former foes and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures from confiscating tory property in violation of the treaty of 1783
many believe and understandably that the great difference between the constitution of the southern confederacy and the federal constitution was that the former recognized the right of each state to secede but though each of its members had	this right against the union the final constitution which the confederacy signed on march 11 nearly a month before hostilities began included no explicit provision authorizing a state to secede its drafters discussed this vital point but left it out of their constitution
one is tempted to say that on the difference between the concepts of sovereignty in these two preambles the worst war of the nineteenth century was fought but though the southern states when drafting a constitution to unite themselves narrowed the difference to this fine point by omitting to	the right to secede the fact remained that by seceding from the union they had already acted on the concept that it was composed primarily of sovereign states if the union conceded this to them the same right must be conceded to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to secede this would destroy the federal balance between it and the states and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their union

by 1987 thenspeaker jim wright was discussing arms control in moscow with mikhail gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president through an appropriations rider to treat the soviets as though the senate had ratified salt ii if a veto is unworkable because it would leave part of the executive branch unfunded the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and	a power of excision declaring the rider restricting his article ii powers to be unconstitutional and severable the constitution does not expressly give the president such power
one could argue that it is not an	of a item veto at all for the president by exerting a power of excision to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers there is no downside if the president asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills if congress does nothing president bush will have won
there still are some details to be nailed down mr bush is reserving the right in rare instances to keep congress in the dark	a constitutional prerogative the committee does nt recognize and a pending justice department interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions that would have to be settled
he has argued that such presidential power is necessary to rein in congressional spending but some analysts particularly conservative legal scholars have urged mr bush not to wait for explicit authorization but simply to	that the constitution already implicitly gives him the power to exercise a lineitem veto such an assertion most likely would bring about a court challenge from congress that would clarify whether a president already has such power

the government s startling allegations filed only days before the scheduled start of a criminal overcharge trial against ge in philadelphia federal district court challenge the motives and veracity of the nation s thirdlargest defense contractor in a strongly worded response summarizing a filing made in the same court yesterday ge	that prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses distorted documents and ignored important facts the company attacked the government s allegations as reckless and baseless mudslinging and said its management promptly and accurately reported to the pentagon all relevant information about billing practices
when ge finally disclosed the problems prosecutors contend that mr orr was erroneously informed that the lcb suspected rcb practices had only just been discovered by ge management in its brief the government	that it needs the internal ge documents to rebut anticipated efforts by ge during the trial to demonstrate its good corporate character ge which was surprised by the lastminute subpoena for more than 100 boxes and file cabinets of documents countered that senior ge managers did nt find out about questionable billing practices until 1985 and that the information was passed on quickly to mr orr at his first meeting with company representatives
ge s filing contends that the billing practices at the heart of the current controversy involved technical disputes rather than criminal activity the company s conduct does not even raise a question of wrongful corporate intent ratification or coverup ge s brief	on the contrary it shows a corporation reacting swiftly and aggressively to very difficult issues in largely uncharted waters

the innocence that they tried to conceal at the beginning is clearly destroyed forever when one of them asking for a piece of lemonmeringue pie gets a plate of english muffins instead leaving the theatre after the performance i had a flash of intuition that life after all lrb as rilke said rrb is just a search for the nonexistent cup of hot coffee and that this unpretentious moving clever bitter slice of life was the greatest thing to	to the american theatre since brooks atkinson retired aging but still precocious french feline enfant terrible francoisette lagoon has succeeded in shocking jaded old paris again this time with a sexy ballet scenario called the lascivious interlude the story of a nymphomaniac triphammer operator who falls hopelessly in love with a middleaged steam shovel

senatorschumer we agree that that ought to	senatorschumer it ought to happen in a dignified way senatorschumer it ought to happen in thoughtful way
senatorschumer it ought to	in a dignified way senatorschumer it ought to happen in thoughtful way senatorschumer but it certainly ought to happen
senatorschumer it ought to	in thoughtful way senatorschumer but it certainly ought to happen larryking he wo nt make the court if approved until january right
senatorschumer i would have hoped that the president would choose a real consensus nominee who would have much broader support senatorschumer but i think what	here is not a single senator for instance said that uh harriet myers nomination should be withdrawn senatorschumer sam may have been on the edge
senatorschumer and you know i got to tell you this larry senatorschumer i ca nt tell you what will	with judge alito senatorschumer i think it s very close as david gergen said

generalabizaid that s to drive us out before the iraqis are ready to assume the battle space generalabizaid if that s what	they could win generalabizaid but but it s very very clear to me that we re going to stay the course that we re going to build iraqi security capacity that the iraqi are serious about being partners in this effort and they re very serious about taking over the effort
generalabizaid but ultimately we did generalabizaid and that s what s going to	with the iraqi armed forces as well generalabizaid they need time
generalabizaid it brings foreign fighters in from saudi arabia and north africa generalabizaid it is connected to what is	in afghanistan and what is happening in pakistan generalabizaid it is a global battle that we face
generalabizaid it brings foreign fighters in from saudi arabia and north africa generalabizaid it is connected to what is	in afghanistan and what is happening in pakistan generalabizaid it is a global battle that we face
generalabizaid uh but it s not the only battle wolfblitzer is it time to reconsider women american women in combat in the aftermath of what	this past week wolfblitzer more american women died in combat were injured i believe in any time since world war two
wolfblitzer that s a disturbing element i assume for you as far as the demoralization of the us military generalabizaid that the only thing i can tell you wolf is when i go to the field the soldiers are uniformly confident about their ability to face this enemy make iraq afghanistan whatever area they	to be operating in better defeat the terrorist wherever they find them and they all understand it s going to take time generalabizaid it it it s not a sprint
carllevin but i do nt think so carllevin i think that the problem here that we ve had right from the beginning is overly optimistic predictions on the part of what would	if we attacked iraq carllevin and it s these policies which need to be changed
presidentemilelahoud for sure it s not lebanon nor syria presidentemilelahoud because until the assassination everything was fine the stability and security were at its best according to interpol who are number one on the list of security in the world presidentemilelahoud and what	made us uh go back because we lost a lot by it and i m sure that nobody harms himself presidentemilelahoud so it could nt be syria nor lebanon
presidentemilelahoud we said because they were trying to unstable lebanon presidentemilelahoud and eh another thing	only a few months before the assassination of president presidentemilelahoud and that was when uh eh uh they tried to put a bomb in the uh italian embassy
jonkyl if we have a profile of some kind of killer in this society and frankly there s a rapist on the loose in arizona right now and there is a a picture that s been drawn of by by police uh artists of what this guy looks like jonkyl and anybody that has an appearance somewhat like him should expect to be profiled by the police here jonkyl by the way he	to be a young white male apparently jonkyl but whatever the appearance of a potential terrorist is is fair game for profiling
waynehale that is the problem that we have to solve for the next flight waynehale for this flight we are we understand what	in terms of damage to the orbiter waynehale and we believe it will be safe to reenter
waynehale we have provisions to bring back the entire seven person crew of discovery if required in an emergency situation waynehale we certainly do nt think that s going to	at this point waynehale but we re holding that preparation um in readiness in case something changes
waynehale we ve built the recumbant seats waynehale um and the other emergency provisions to bring back that larger crew on a single rescue flight if required wolfblitzer how did this miscalculation	waynehale you know we looked very hard at the foam on the pal ramp before flight
wolfblitzer but a quick question wolfblitzer when do you believe if it	the next shuttle will take off waynehale well we are we are putting together a team that will go off and do an investigation uh and come up with the solution on this problem
bobwoodward sure a little bit bobwoodward but you know what what	ah bobwoodward there were so many specifics in our stories ah about money and and high level people in the white house and the nixon campaign that the prosecutors could subpoena them and get them to talk which eventually they did
bobwoodward i ve got other things to do bobwoodward ah i know what	bobwoodward he kn he knows ah what happened
bobwoodward ah i know what	bobwoodward he kn he knows ah what happened bobwoodward i what s the loop to close
bobwoodward who knows ah bobwoodward funny things	bobwoodward but i think ah felt s lawyer and family can do ah something that s going to add to the record on all of this
howardkurtz but that her former boss says no way howardkurtz that never	howardkurtz and the times was so conflicted in covering the controversy the editors killed the story about libby and pulled their punches in other ways
howardkurtz arianna huffington the times piece a lengthy piece acknowledges that judy miller was a controversial figure in the newsroom whose own wmd reporting was wrong howardkurtz and that while she claims to have pushed for this uh story on valerie plame two years ago jill abrahamson now the paper s managing editor says no way howardkurtz that did nt	howardkurtz in other words there s a dispute in the accounts
ariannahuffington and the similarities for the jayson blair case ariannahuffington remember after the jayson blair scandal broke we had a seven thousand word story that did not give a full account of what	ariannahuffington especially about why is a major institution like the times ignoring so many red flags howardkurtz alright
ariannahuffington the truth is that it s very clear from the stories today that she could ve asked uh scooter libby to call her so that she could hear the timber of his voice earlier ariannahuffington all of that could have happened ariannahuffington it did not	because clearly judy miller is protecting another source that she still has not revealed to the american public
ariannahuffington all of that could have happened ariannahuffington it did not	because clearly judy miller is protecting another source that she still has not revealed to the american public ariannahuffington and the new york times is
franksesno you re going to walk through it franksesno so that it	does nt surprise me franksesno that it hurts the president yeah that s inevitable too
howardkurtz jay carson is the spokesman for former president bill clinton lannydavis jay carson is the spokesperson for president clinton was not informed about the specific charge about the khobar towers which	to be not true lannydavis president clinton at that re uh meeting did press the uh crown prince to cooperate with the fbi
tomfriedman but there s only one way we win this war howie is it takes a village tomfriedman it only	when the sunni muslim world basically turns people in tomfriedman and when the sunni muslim world restrains their own tomfriedman and what was so shocking to me about this story a sunni jihadi suicide bomber blows up a mosque number one on the first day of ramadan
tomfriedman and there s so much fatigue that we do nt sit back and say wait a minute tomfriedman what	today tomfriedman a sunni muslim fundamentalist went into a mosque on the first day of ramadan their holiest day
tomfriedman but at the end of the day the bush administration made a very big claim um that it could go to iraq um and produce a decent forward looking government there tomfriedman if that happens then i think president bush is going to have a a very huge quiver you know in his uh legacy there tomfriedman um if it if it does nt	i think uh the administration will be seen as a complete and utter failure
tomfriedman if that happens then i think president bush is going to have a a very huge quiver you know in his uh legacy there tomfriedman um if it if it does nt	i think uh the administration will be seen as a complete and utter failure tomfriedman so everything rides on this not just for the administration though but for the american people

larrykobilinsky and i think good policework would connect the individuals in question with the casino with mister smith larrykobilinsky and that might help us understand what	danabrams excuse this is um a little bit more sound
danabrams i mean even when i was down there i saw the kinds of hours uh that people were working etcetera danabrams and i know that there was a the goal was to give a lot of people some time off uh right after this	in order to allow them to to get their wits back to be able to relax a little bit danabrams but you know you look at this guy you know punching the the one guy grabbing the ap producer you know

jaysekulow they could ask him to come in through a subpoena jaysekulow they can also which will probably	through the investigative process that s probably under way as we speak dan find out about the this information jaysekulow but let me tell you something
elliotminkford that means even more important than dobson or rove testifying is her testifying in a straightforwrad way what both republicans and democrats want to know danabrams but that s look that s not going to	all right danabrams look it s not it s that s just all right tha that s all right but that s a nice theory
danabrams look it s not it s that s just all right tha that s all right but that s a nice theory danabrams it s not going to	danabrams i can i can promise you that
danabrams i promise you she will not answer the questions that you want answered danabrams i mean it wo nt	elliotminkford if you re right about that if you re right about that
elliotminkford i would nt b i would nt be surprised for the first time to see republican and democratic senators unite and say we need to know more about the nominee danabrams that may look tha that may ha th that may	danabrams but anyone who s now claiming that they expect to get the answers from miers in the confirmation hearing that s going to somehow uh assure them one way or the other are just grandstanding because they know they re not going to get it
russellvancamp but when it shocks the conscience of the average person russellvancamp and any any normal human bead would be human being would be shocked by what	here and how easy it would have been for uh the uh responsible authorities to look back at a twenty five year history of this devil incarnate and uh not let him loose russellvancamp and this situation would not have happened
russellvancamp and any any normal human bead would be human being would be shocked by what	here and how easy it would have been for uh the uh responsible authorities to look back at a twenty five year history of this devil incarnate and uh not let him loose russellvancamp and this situation would not have happened russellvancamp the family wants to stop this for the future
russellvancamp that s what they want to do danabrams is there a danger that if if lawsuits like this succeed that that basically any time a uh public official does something uh acts in a particular way or does nt act that if something horrible	later that person will be held civily responsible russellvancamp well in this type of case especially now
russellvancamp and through their neglegence uh we lost human lives russellvancamp and then horrendous things	to little kids russellvancamp and uh th this is the kind of case that s an exception to that kind of generalization that you talk about
russellvancamp and uh th this is the kind of case that s an exception to that kind of generalization that you talk about danabrams an and you think it s fair then to say that y you blame the minnesota authorities for everything that	here russellvancamp we blame the responsible hired employees of this county to do their job correctly and do it right and not just go through every day on a rote type situation
russellvancamp this guy should have never been let out and should have never been given a bond russellvancamp and had they done their job right back there and had uh in invesigated it properly in this information age that we we have it is my opinion and the families opinion this would have not	russellvancamp but we want to stop this from happening in the future
russellvancamp and had they done their job right back there and had uh in invesigated it properly in this information age that we we have it is my opinion and the families opinion this would have not	russellvancamp but we want to stop this from happening in the future danabrams yeah well look i think we uh we all do
danabrams all i ve heard is skepticism about the threat danabrams if it	then you want to blame bush for not acting danabrams if he does he s trying to walk the dog
chrismatthews and he s with most people on the social issues speaker1 well i	to think that the way karl rove and george bush are trying to redefine the issue which is about domestic security speaker1 they do nt want to talk about the war because the war s a mess
darryllittlejohn and they have to be darryllittlejohn the family has to be devastated darryllittlejohn i mean i m truly i m truly sorry what	to this young lady darryllittlejohn but they have the wrong person
raykelly you know when that becomes a crime i think we should all get out of this business danabrams but but the problem gail abramson is it is a crime if the if the bar manager lied to the authorities about what	led them on a wild goose chase danabrams um you re allowed to say nothing
sally um you know i m i m beyond that at this point sally i i i have to tell you that i uh when all of this first	i you know i saw this young teacher sally she is not my son s student
alyssarayburger i m alyssa rayburger alyssarayburger and here s what s	alyssarayburger authorities say the wife and three young daughters of a murdered tennessee minister were found safe and alone on a thursday night in alabama when police spotted their van
danabrams you spoke to her father danabrams um you know she s saying that this was perfectly clear what	that she starts goes home with this guy at age fourteen and then he effectively locks her in the home karenwells that s what she says
alexthier and many of those same people are back in power alexthier and afghanistan really represents something that s	in the broader islamic world which is a tension between democratic values on one hand and islamic values on the other hand danabrams i mean because the afghan constitution ar article two point two says followers of other religions are free to exercise their faith and perform their religious rights within the limits of the provisions of law
danabrams well let me ask you about danabrams i mean since you were involved in helping them create their constitution and their law wh when you were helping them do that did you foresee something like this maybe	alexthier we absolutely did
alexthier you re right dan alexthier it s a travesty um that something like this could	anywhere in the world alexthier and i think that it really contains a very important lesson for us in that we really need to pay close attention not to just broad questions like elections but specifically the law in countries like this
danabrams i mean is the president going to be able to work on this diplomatically as he says and with the people that they have contacts with and resolve this danabrams i mean it sounds like what s going to	is the government s going to declare this guy mentally ill alexthier well i think that the government is is really looking for a way out of this
davidgregory everybody up there in new york understands that as well that he can push the the us agenda davidgregory and then we ll see what	davidgregory i mean if he can prove to some democrats that uh he can work well with others up there perhaps he changes some minds
davidgregory i mean if he can prove to some democrats that uh he can work well with others up there perhaps he changes some minds davidgregory maybe that s uh that s not going to	davidgregory but the bottom line this is that this is not an administration that thinks very highly of the united nations
normcoleman it was it was a meeting in which they re talking about one world government normcoleman he was saying hey folks it s not going to	chrismatthews oh do nt
chrismatthews uh i do nt think so normcoleman it s not going to	normcoleman and the bottom line is that a lot of folks would say the un has not been as effective as it should be
normcoleman that s why the president is going to be speaking there normcoleman and he has got a guy by his side who can help make that	chrismatthews so i should nt have quoted him
normcoleman yes it did normcoleman i wish it did nt	chrismatthews do you think the un can still play the role that fdr and the other americans at that time thought it could of being the peacemaking uh organization to keep us from fighting war after war in the world
benginsberg yeah i think john bolton is going to surprise people the un chrismatthews will they will that	benginsberg yes depending on the election results
stevemcmahon well this investigation they never put a reporter in jail they never put a reporter in jail for something stevemcmahon in fact it s never	before benginsberg
chrismatthews uh uh he means in chains chrismatthews do you think that is going to	stevemcmahon i i think that s unlikely
chrismatthews how do we know that those bullies wo nt eventually grab control again the minute we leave melanie melaniemorgan we have no idea what s going to	melaniemorgan i m not uh uh uh a psychic
chrismatthews the same question to you paul chrismatthews you know in the beginning of world war two the worst thing that	uh in the century uh the uh the french army was bigger and more impressive than the german army chrismatthews but the german army wanted to kill
chrismatthews we re back with radio talk show host melanie morgan and iraq war veteren paul rieckhoff chrismatthews melanie how do we get the straight scoop on what s	in iraq because people tell me there s only two ways to go over there as a journalist i think your experience confirms this you either go over there and stay in the green zone or that that part of uh uh which is very secure and it s basically a compound or you go out with a unit as an embedded uh basically part of the unit an embedded reporter chrismatthews you never really get to mix with the locals
paulrieckhoff there s a likelihood that i ll go back while ms morgan is back at her radio show paulrieckhoff so what i really want to do is educate the public about the truth of what s	there paulrieckhoff and i think the reality is that when people like her go over there there s a public affairs officer standing right next to that young soldier
sherrodbrown and we re seeing exactly the opposite sherrodbrown but what	in southwest ohio secretary blackwell s right sherrodbrown it s a it s a wakeup call with a message
kenblackwell let me just say to you chris that what i said was that ron ronald reagan and george bush cut taxes and they started to restrain state government spending kenblackwell what has	in the state of ohio is that bob taft has increased spending and he has in fact raised taxes kenblackwell and i think that anybody that runs on a tax raising runaway spending platform is going to lose because they re going to undercut our base
mikegowan and it says the holy koran mikegowan so the idea is to show uh lawmakers the better part of what s	there mikegowan each of the guides pointed out to us the black uh arrows that you see everywhere are showing where mecca is

stevenlynch well if if he was using steroids during his testimony or prior to his testimony obviously he has committed perjury and has tried to mislead the congress in a in an ongoing investigation stevenlynch so uh it it has uh a lot to do about what	next chrismatthews would you like to see him charged with perjury if he did chrismatthews h uh if there s evidence now hard evidence to a drug test that he was in fact using steroids back then before the testimony
bobshrum they do nt want him appointing chrismatthews what	in fifty bobshrum they do nt want him appointing

bobshrum be over bobshrum it s not going to	bobshrum there there are real differences between the parties here
condoleezzarice u uh saddam was not related to the events of september eleventh condoleezzarice but if you really believe that the only thing that	on september eleventh was people flew airplanes into buildings i think you have a very narrow view of what we faced on september eleventh condoleezzarice we faced the um the outcome of an ideology of hatred throughout the middle east that had to be dealt with
timrussert there s a story moving on the wires that the afghan court has just dismissed the charges against this gentleman who had converted to christianity timrussert are you aware that was going to	condoleezzarice i i ca nt confirm uh that particular report uh tim
condoleezzarice but the last part of that s right timrussert will not	condoleezzarice i do nt think it s going to happen
timrussert will not	condoleezzarice i do nt think it s going to happen timrussert madame secretary as always we thank you for shar sharing your views
johnharwood uh the white house one of the ways elisabeth mentioned trying to thread the needle one of the things they were looking at is trying to push the final resolution of this until after the midterm election johnharwood that also could	on some budget issues as well as a way of trying to make some sort of common cause between moderate democrats and moderate republicans timrussert you know in two thousand florida florida florida
charliecook they can see that it s not going well charliecook and what	in fifteen provinces does nt matter charliecook what if they think that this thing is just really going to hell in a handbasket um it s ki i mean that s what you know that s that
elisabethbumiller so i that s elisabethbumiller it s unclear if anything s going to	timrussert john
timrussert john johnharwood well chances are pretty good something will	johnharwood the president of course did nt rule out the idea of bringing someone on
charliecook and you ve got to knock out five of them charliecook now it can	charliecook but it s hard
elisabethbumiller and you know karl rove has told people he s optomistic they can hang on to both houses um uh if if elisabethbumiller but he also has said yes it can	the way charlie cook says elisabethbumiller and you know you re going to see the pre
johnharwood winning the war in iraq is the top priority johnharwood and secondly it might not be the worst thing to	to george w bush if democrats had a weak majority johnharwood you could see some deals cut especially on entitlement programs the last two years if democrats try to resolve a problem before they hope they get a president in two thousand nine
timrussert but it s going an ongoing issue as secretary rice seemed to indicate as that democracy in afghanistan goes through some serious growing pains dealing with religious rights women s rights civil rights human rights elisabethbumiller right well this is what	when you call for democracy in in problematic parts of the world elisabethbumiller we saw this in the elections in the palestinian territories obviously
timrussert do nt take a chance by going on with these other guys and doing something dangerous davidbroder if that	the republicans would benefit davidbroder and the country would benefit
chuckschummer had they come to congress a few years on this a few years ago on this issue my guess is they would have gotten most of what they wanted chuckschummer but what s	here because there is such a view that the president s power is infinite and unchecked by anybody first time ever a president has had those kinds of views they keep running into brick walls chuckschummer in this case a supreme court that has generally been sympathetic to executive power chuckschummer and so we re going to have to not only look at this issue
chuckschummer and it s a fair bill chuckschummer but here s what s	chuckschummer there s a who you know there s a wing of the republican party that does nt want that bill
chuckschummer and we re doing everything we can to help him chuckschummer i m not going to speculate on what happens after the primary chuckschummer because we believe joe leiberman is going to win chuckschummer and it i m not going to undermine my candidate by speculating about what might	afterwards
chuckschummer i m not going to speculate on what happens after the primary chuckschummer because we believe joe leiberman is going to win chuckschummer and it i m not going to undermine my candidate by speculating about what might	afterwards chuckschummer we think he s going to win
chuckschummer it does nt make sense chuckschummer when you have a candidate you re supporting you do nt say what	if he does nt win mitchmcconnell andrea

andreamitchel bill safire should the administration take this as a cue to just shut guantanamo or accept the john mccain approach now towards billsafire no i think uh the administration should follow what the the guideline that the supreme court has suggested which is go to congress and and get some kind of solid guidelines on what should	billsafire wonderful thing here
